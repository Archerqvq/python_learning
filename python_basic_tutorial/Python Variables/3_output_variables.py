# Output Variables
# The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
# Example
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
# Example
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

# You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome "
print(x + y + z)

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

# In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:
# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x + y)
